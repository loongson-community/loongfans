### High Energy Consumption

Laptops that uses AVS (Adaptive Voltage Scaling) and not the full DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) are known to have higher energy consumptions. Laptops that offers a limited range of core voltage modulation is especially prone to higher power consumption and less-than-ideal battery runtime.
