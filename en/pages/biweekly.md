The LoongArch Biweekly is a regular community meeting organized by Loongson hobbyists. The meeting agenda comprises updates on upstream projects, Linux distro (and other OS projects), and community affairs. The reports are generally followed by contributor discussions and Q&A sessions.

The meeting is held every other Sunday at 2:00 PM (UTC+8) on Tencent Meeting, and is simultaneously livestreamed on Bilibili page [@龙芯爱好者社区](https://space.bilibili.com/70360929). Offline meetings are also arranged from time to time.

::: tip
The LoongArch Biweekly currently uses Chinese as the default language, but we welcome users of other languages - many of us speak English (some even speak Russian). If you'd like to hold a session in another langauge, please feel free to get in touch!
