| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |

The above is for illustrative purposes only. Please adhere to markdownlint's
"compact" style while authoring tables, like below:

| Tables | Are | Cool |
| --- | :-: | --: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

The two tables should render identically.
