The CTCISZ 2K0300 ForeverPi is a development board launched by CTCISZ, designed based on the 2K0300 platform.

## Main Specifications

::: info
ForeverPi has two models: TF card version and Wi-Fi version. Since the Wi-Fi module uses the SDIO bus, the microSD (TF) card slot and Wi-Fi module can only choose one. In addition, the Wi-Fi version also comes with 4GB eMMC and an LCD interface, and the onboard NOR Flash capacity is larger (8Mbit for Wi-Fi version, 256Mbit for TF card version).
