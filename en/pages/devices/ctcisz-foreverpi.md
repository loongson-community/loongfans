The CTCISZ 2K0300 ForeverPi is a development board based on Loongson 2K0300.

## Key Specifications

::: info
ForeverPi is available in two variants: "TF Card" and "Wi-Fi". Since both the Wi-Fi module and the microSD (TF) card slot use the SDIO bus, only one can be equipped at a time. The Wi-Fi version additionally features 4GB onboard eMMC storage and an LCD interface, while the onboard NOR Flash capacity differs between variants (8Mbit on Wi-Fi, 256Mbit on TF Card).
