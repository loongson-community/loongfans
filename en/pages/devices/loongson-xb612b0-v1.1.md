The Loongson XB612B0_V1.1 is an mATX (244×244mm) desktop motherboard from Loongson Technology based on the 3B6000 platform.

The motherboard supports various 3B6000 processor configurations including 8/12/16 cores with 16/24/32 threads, as well as Registered ECC memory. It features two M.2 NVMe (PCIe 3.0 x4) 2280 slots, the most among all Loongson motherboards. Compared to the [AC612A0_V1.1](/en/pages/devices/loongson-ac612a0-v1.1.md) based on the 3C6000/S platform, the XB612B0_V1.1 has 2 fewer memory slots and 1 fewer PCIe 3.0 x8 slot. However, given its smaller form factor, the motherboard still offers impressive features, expandability, and better value for individual users.
