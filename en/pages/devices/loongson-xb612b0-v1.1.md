The Loongson XB612B0_V1.1 is an mATX (244×244mm) desktop motherboard launched by Loongson Technology, designed based on the 3B6000 platform.

This motherboard can support multiple specifications of 3B6000 processors, supporting models with 8/12/16 cores, 16/24/32 threads, and supports Registered ECC memory. The motherboard also provides 2 m.2 NVMe (PCIe 3.0 x4) 2280 interfaces, making it the model with the most NVMe interfaces among Loongson-based motherboards. Compared to the [AC612A0_V1.1](/en/pages/devices/loongson-ac612a0-v1.1.md) based on 3C6000/S, although the XB612B0_V1.1 motherboard provides 2 fewer memory slots and 1 fewer PCIe 3.0 x8 interface, considering its relatively smaller form factor, this motherboard still has a remarkable feature set and expandability, and offers better value for money for individual users.
